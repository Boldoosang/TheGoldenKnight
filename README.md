Welcome to my COMP 3609 Game Programming final project! This game was designed using the teachings of the COMP 3609 gaming programming course as well as the Brackeen's guide to game development. The story follows our protagonist, Benjamin, a Golden Knight, as he collects pieces of the Chalice of Ruins to ultimately close the assassin syndicate portal.
